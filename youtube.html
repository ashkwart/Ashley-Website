        <h2> A Case Study on Youtube Ads</h2>

        <p class = "italics"> "How can YouTube better focus on user satisfaction by rethinking its ad strategies to minimize disruption?"</p>

        <hr>

        <h3> Introduction</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> Youtube is a popular video sharing website. Youtube was founded with the intention to rid of cable TV<br>
            with a focus on creativity and has facillitated some of the most iconic media moments to date.<br>

            While advertising is essential for YouTube's revenue, <br>
            it can create interruptions in the viewing experience, leading to user frustration.
        </p>

        <h3> Purpose </h3>
        <p> This case study aims to investigate how YouTube's current advertising
            practices contribute to user dissatisfaction. <br>By understanding the impact of ads, 
            we can propose actionable recommendations to enhance user experience.</p>


        <h3> Problem Identification </h3>
        <hr>
        <p> Youtube has gone overboard with the ads! For a company who's main goal was to ellimainate<br>
            the need for cable, they are now apart of the problem 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Types of Ads:</strong><br>
            YouTube features several ad formats, including skippable ads, non-skippable ads, and mid-roll ads, each affecting the user experience differently.<br>
            Non-skippable ads, which can be as long as 30 seconds, often frustrate users who prefer quick content consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>User Feedback:</strong><br>
            User complaints about ads often center around:<br>
            - <em>Frequency</em>: Many users feel overwhelmed by the number of ads they encounter during a single viewing session.<br>
            - <em>Relevance</em>: Ads that do not match usersâ€™ interests lead to disengagement and dissatisfaction.<br>
            - <em>Length</em>: Long ad interruptions disrupt the flow of content, resulting in annoyance and potential abandonment of videos.<br>
            A study by the Digital Marketing Institute found that 80% of users reported feeling frustrated by excessive ad interruptions, impacting their overall perception of the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Impact on User Experience:</strong><br>
            The accumulation of negative experiences related to ads can lead users to seek alternative platforms or use ad blockers, undermining YouTube's viewer base.<br>
            Many users express a desire for more control over their ad experiences, such as the ability to choose the types of ads they see or the option for an ad-free experience.
        </p>
        <h3> Background Research</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> I conducted several in person and digital surveys surrounding youtube AD's and general<br>
        user satisfaction surrounding them</p>
